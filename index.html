                <h3>Selector Specificity</h3>
                <p><strong>Selector specificity</strong> is a measure of how specific a CSS selector is in targeting an element. It determines which style rules take precedence when multiple rules match the same element.</p>
                <p>Specificity is calculated based on the type of selector and its components: inline styles, IDs, classes, elements, and pseudo-classes/pseudo-elements. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes, attributes, pseudo-classes, elements, and finally pseudo-elements.</p>
                <p>For example, a selector targeting an element with an ID would have higher specificity than a selector targeting the same element with a class.</p>

                <h3>Complex Selectors</h3>
                <p><strong>Complex selectors</strong> are CSS selectors that combine multiple simple selectors to target specific elements based on various conditions and relationships within the document tree.</p>
                <p>These selectors can include combinators such as descendant selectors, child selectors, adjacent sibling selectors, and general sibling selectors to create more specific and precise targeting.</p>
                <p>For example, a complex selector might target all paragraphs within a `<div>` element with a class of "container": <code>div.container p</code>.</p>

                <h3>Pseudo-classes vs Pseudo-elements</h3>
                <p><strong>Pseudo-classes</strong> are keywords added to selectors that define a special state or condition of an element. They are preceded by a colon (:) in CSS selectors. Pseudo-classes include <code>:hover</code>, <code>:active</code>, <code>:focus</code>, <code>:first-child</code>, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Pseudo-elements</strong>, on the other hand, are keywords that target specific parts of an element's content or structure. They are preceded by two colons (::) in CSS selectors. Pseudo-elements include <code>::before</code>, <code>::after</code>, <code>::first-line</code>, <code>::first-letter</code>, etc.</p>
